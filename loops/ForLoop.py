"""
 Loops in Python (Used to repeat a block of code multiple times) to perform iterations.
 Loops is used to avoid code redundancy and to automate repetitive tasks.
 There are two main types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.
 """

# For Loop
# A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
# It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
#syntax:
# for item in sequence:

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)    

# Practice Example
# Q1 : print the elements of the following list using for loop.
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

# Q2 : search for a number x in this tuple using for loop.

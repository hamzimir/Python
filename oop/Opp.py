OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for
better organization and reusability.
Advantages of OOP:-
Provides a clear structure to programs
Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Allows you to build reusable applications with less code
Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into 
functions or classes and reuse it.

"""
Python is an object oriented programming language.
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
"""
"""
To create a class, use the keyword class:
Example
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
"""
class MyClass:
  x = 5

"""
  Create Object
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
"""
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
